# LazyEnder

LazyEnder is a powerful text-to-image generator that allows you to create stunning images from simple text prompts. This project consists of a web interface where users can enter prompts, which are then sent to a server via WebSocket. The server processes the prompt and sends back the generated image via WebSocket, which is then displayed to the user on the website.
